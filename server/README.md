# Qlash WebSocket Server

WebSocket relay server for the Qlash multiplayer quiz. Handles room management, player connections, and message relay between host and players. All state is held in memory (no database).

## Local Development

```bash
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```

The server starts on port 8080 (or `PORT` env variable). Health check: `GET http://localhost:8080/health`

To connect from the client, set `WS_URL` in your local `qlash-config.js`:

```js
const WS_URL = 'ws://localhost:8080';
```

## Deploy to Fly.io

### First-time setup

1. Install the Fly CLI: https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/

2. Sign up / log in:
   ```bash
   fly auth signup   # or: fly auth login
   ```

3. Launch the app (from the `server/` directory):
   ```bash
   cd server
   fly launch
   ```
   This creates the app on Fly.io using the existing `fly.toml` and `Dockerfile`.
   Note: `fly launch` creates 2 machines by default for high availability. Scale down to 1 for the free tier:
   ```bash
   fly scale count 1 --app qlash-server
   ```

4. Add the `FLY_API_TOKEN` secret to your GitHub repository for automated deploys:
   ```bash
   fly tokens create deploy -x 999999h
   ```
   Copy the token and add it as `FLY_API_TOKEN` in GitHub repo Settings > Secrets > Actions.

5. Add the `WS_URL` secret to GitHub (used by the build pipeline to inject into the client):
   - Value: `wss://qlash-server.fly.dev` (or your custom domain)
   - Add as `WS_URL` in GitHub repo Settings > Secrets > Actions.

### Manual deploy

```bash
cd server
fly deploy
```

### Automated deploy

Pushes to `main` that change files in `server/` automatically trigger deployment via `.github/workflows/deploy-server.yml`.

## Architecture

- Single Fly.io machine in `fra` (Frankfurt)
- `auto_stop_machines = "stop"`: machine sleeps when idle (no active connections), saving free-tier hours
- `auto_start_machines = true`: machine wakes on incoming request (~2-3s cold start)
- In-memory state is lost when machine sleeps, but rooms auto-expire after 2 hours anyway
- Rooms are cleaned up when the host terminates the quiz or after 2 hours of inactivity
- Host disconnect grace period: 60 seconds before the room is terminated
- Ping/pong heartbeat every 30 seconds to detect dead connections
